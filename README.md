> This project is developed primarily for **personal use and educational purposes** to understand traditional Vedic time calculations such as *Ghadi‚ÄìPala‚ÄìVighati*. It involves **precise astronomical and mathematical computations**, which may have **minor inaccuracies** depending on factors like timezone handling, API limitations, or floating-point precision.

> While efforts have been made to ensure high accuracy, **this tool should not be solely relied upon for professional astrological purposes**. It's always recommended to **double-check results manually** or consult verified Panchang sources when absolute precision is required.

> üôè This project is a humble attempt to blend tradition with technology. Feel free to improve it, customize the design, or adapt it for your own needs. Beauty lies in how you shape it.
